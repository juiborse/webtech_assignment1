<!-- Why Use IDs in CSS?
An ID in CSS is used to apply styles to a single, unique HTML element. IDs are more specific than classes and are intended to be unique within the document. This uniqueness allows IDs to be used for:

Unique Styling: Applying a specific style to a single element.
JavaScript Targeting: Easily targeting elements for scripting.
Fragment Identifiers: Navigating to specific parts of a webpage. -->

<!-- aaplying both id and class attribute for single element -->
<h1 id="x1" class="y1">
    Hello World!!!
</h1>
