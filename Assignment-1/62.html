<!-- Why Use Classes in CSS?
Reusability: Classes can be reused across multiple elements.
Modularity: Classes help keep CSS modular and organized.
Specificity: Classes can be more specific than tag selectors but less specific than IDs.
Maintainability: Classes make it easier to update styles since changes to a class affect all elements using that class. -->
